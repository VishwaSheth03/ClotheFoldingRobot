# ClotheFoldingRobot

This code was used to control a clothe-folding robot.
It's purpose was to fold clothes placed on top of it using three flaps,
rotate on an axis to find a line colour matching the colour of the shirt,
and follow until the end of the line to drop the clothing.
The user also had the option of selecting to sort by type, in which case the robot
looked for one coloured line for pants, and another coloured line for shirts.
